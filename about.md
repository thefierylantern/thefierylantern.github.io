Hi there random visitor,

My name is Phan Minh Dang and I am a combination of graphic deisgner, web deisigner and illustrator.

Art is my passion but I am also interested in interactive media and product design. While studying at university, I wrote an essay about the value of "Art". I found an really interesting quote, by Oscar Wilde, written down in his letter to Bernulf Clegg: "A work of art is useless as a flower is useless. A flower blossoms for its own joy". At first, I do believe in it. Later, with more research and effort, I found out the modern form of art, called "Design". Unlike the traditional form of Art, this new form has more opportunities to practice in the daily, from media to advertising and identity design, from website to application and game. This is why I love being a designer. This is why I chose to become a designer, to create, to experience and to change people.

If you are looking for something interesting, this page will not provide anything cause it is under developing.

However, you can still find more information about me at my [Deveiant](http://thefierylantern.deviantart.com/) or [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=300855638&trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile).

And I also want to say thanks you to [Mu-An](http://muan.co) for developed Jekyll and [Hung Phan](http://github.com/hung-phan) for supporting with this site.
